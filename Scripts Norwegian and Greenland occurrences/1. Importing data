#The dataframes for each of the time slots were downloaded, though the GBIF API for R. Fossil specimens and living specimens  (i.e. a specimen that is alive, such as in a botanical garden or a zoo, by GBIF definition) were excluded. The blocks of information included request to the server and import directly to R. Id-s fields were retrieved for consulting more fields in case that it was needed afterwards. The WGS datum corresponds to WGS84 (EPSG 4326). The files from the Norwegian North Atlantic expedition were digitalized accordingly with the fields of information used in GBIF and OBIS and selected for subsequent data processing.
